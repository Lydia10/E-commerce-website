# E-commerce Website
This is a project that uses the Mern stack. It is a fully functional E-commerce site. You can add products, checkout, pay ( using Stripe's API ), create an account and sign in. It also has sophisticated search functionality using MongoDB Atlas Search. I wrote all the css code without using any framework.
